        <h2>Let's chop, simmer, and sauté our way to gastronomic glory!</h2>
        
        <p><b>Marinating the Meat:</b><br>
        
        1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the meat, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, salt, lemon juice, and cooking oil. Mix well to coat the meat evenly. Allow it to marinate for at least 1-2 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator for best results.<br>
        
        <b>Cooking the Rice:</b><br>
        
        1. Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain the rice.<br>
        
        2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the drained rice, salt, and the whole spices (cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon).<br>
        
        3. Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% cooked (it should still have a slight bite to it). Drain the rice and set it aside.<br>
        
        <b>Assembling the Biryani:</b><br>
        
        1. In a heavy-bottomed and wide pan or biryani pot, add 2-3 tablespoons of ghee and spread it evenly on the bottom.<br>
        
        2. Layer half of the partially cooked rice over the ghee.<br>
        
        3. Add the marinated meat as the next layer, spreading it evenly.<br>
        
        4. Sprinkle half of the chopped mint, coriander leaves, green chilies, saffron milk (if using), and garam masala powder over the meat.<br>
        
        5. Layer the remaining rice over the meat.<br>
        
        6. Top it with the remaining mint, coriander leaves, green chilies, and saffron milk.<br>
        
        7. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to ensure no steam escapes.<br>
        
        <b>Dum Cooking:</b><br>
        
        1. Place the biryani pot on low heat and let it cook on dum (steaming) for about 30-40 minutes. You can also place a tava (griddle) under the pot to ensure even cooking.<br>
        
        2. Once done, turn off the heat and let it sit for 10-15 minutes before opening the lid.<br>
        
        3. Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, taking care not to break the rice grains or meat pieces.<br>
        
        4. Serve hot with raita or salad on the side.<br>
        
        Enjoy your delicious Hyderabadi Dum Biryani!</p>
