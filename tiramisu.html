        <h2>Let's chop, simmer, and sauté our way to gastronomic glory!</h2>
        
        <p><b>Prepare the Mascarpone Filling:</b><br>

        2. Optionally, garnish with dark chocolate shavings and fresh mint leaves.<br>
        
        3. Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy your homemade tiramisu!<br>
