        - 1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine (or dry sherry)<br>
        - 1 teaspoon cornstarch<br>
        
        <b>For the Sauce:</b><br>
        
        - 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br>
        - 2 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar (or rice vinegar)<br>
        - 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce<br>
        - 1 tablespoon sugar<br>
        - 1 teaspoon cornstarch<br>
        
        <b>For the Stir-Fry:</b><br>
        
        - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
        - 3-4 dried red chili peppers (adjust to your spice preference)<br>
        - 2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
        - 1-inch piece of ginger, minced<br>
        - 1/2 cup unsalted peanuts (roasted or raw)<br>
        - 2-3 green onions, chopped<br>
        - Optional: Sichuan peppercorns for added flavor (about 1/2 teaspoon)<br></p>
        
        <h2>Let's chop, simmer, and sauté our way to gastronomic glory!</h2>
        
        <p><b>Marinate the Chicken:</b><br>
        
        1. In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine (or sherry), and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Mix well and let it marinate for about 15-20 minutes.<br>
        
        <b>Prepare the Sauce:</b><br>
        
        1. In another bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar (or rice vinegar), 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Stir until well combined. Set aside.<br>
        
        <b>Stir-Fry the Chicken:</b><br>
        
        1. Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat.<br>
        
        2. Add the dried red chili peppers and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until they become fragrant. If you like it spicier, you can break the peppers to release more heat.<br>
        
        3. Add the marinated chicken to the wok. Stir-fry for 4-5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and slightly browned. Remove the chicken from the wok and set it aside.<br>
        
        <b>Finish the Dish:</b><br>
        
        1. In the same wok, add a bit more oil if needed.<br>
        
        2. Add minced garlic and ginger, and optional Sichuan peppercorns if desired. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until aromatic.<br>
        
        3. Return the cooked chicken to the wok and stir to combine with the garlic and ginger.<br>
        
        4. Pour the prepared sauce over the chicken and stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the chicken evenly.<br>
        
        5. Add the unsalted peanuts and stir-fry for an additional 1-2 minutes until they are heated through and slightly crispy.<br>
        
        6. Remove the wok from the heat, stir in the chopped green onions, and give it a final toss.<br>
        
        <b>Serve:</b><br>
        
        1. Serve your homemade Kung Pao Chicken hot over steamed rice.<br>
        
        2. Enjoy the delicious and flavorful combination of tender chicken, crunchy peanuts, and the savory-spicy sauce!<br>
        
        Feel free to adjust the spice level by adding more or fewer dried red chili peppers.</p>
