        2. 1/4 cup semolina (sooji)<br>
        3. 1/2 cup yogurt (dahi)<br>
        4. 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>

        <h2>Let's chop, simmer, and sauté our way to gastronomic glory!</h2>
        
        <p>For Chole (Chickpea Curry):<br>
        
        1. Drain and rinse the soaked chickpeas. In a pressure cooker, add the chickpeas with enough water to cover them by about an inch. Cook for 4-5 whistles or until they are soft and cooked through. Set aside.<br>
        
        2. Heat oil in a large pan or skillet. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle.<br>
        
        3. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.<br>
        
        4. Add the grated ginger and minced garlic. Sauté for another 2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.<br>
        
        5. Add the chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate.<br>
        
        6. Add the chole masala (or ground spices), garam masala, amchur, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.<br>
        
        7. Add the cooked chickpeas along with some of the cooking water. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Adjust the consistency by adding more water if needed.<br>
        
        8. Mash a few chickpeas with the back of a spoon to thicken the gravy. Simmer for a few more minutes until the chole is well-cooked and the gravy is thick.<br>
        
        9. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and keep the chole warm while you prepare the bhature.<br>
        
        For Bhature (Deep-fried Bread):<br>
        
        1. In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, semolina, sugar, baking soda, and salt.<br>
        
        2. Add yogurt and mix well.<br>
        
        3. Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead the dough until it's smooth, soft, and not sticky. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 2-3 hours.<br>
        
        4. Divide the dough into small balls and roll them into oval or round shapes (about 4-5 inches in diameter).<br>
        
        5. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in a bhatura and press it gently with a slotted spoon. This will help it puff up.<br>
        
        6. Fry the bhatura until it puffs up and turns golden brown on both sides. Remove it from the oil and drain on paper towels.<br>
        
        7. Serve the hot Chole with Bhature along with sliced onions, lemon wedges, and some pickles.<br>
