        <h2>Elevate Your Dish with Exceptional Ingredients</h2>
        
        <p><b>For the Sticky Rice:</b><br>
        
        - 1 cup glutinous rice (also known as sweet rice or sticky rice)<br>
        - 1 1/2 cups coconut milk<br>
        - 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br>
        - 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
        - Banana leaves (or parchment paper) for serving (optional)<br>
        
        <b>For the Mango Topping:</b><br>
        
        - 2 ripe mangoes, peeled, pitted, and sliced<br>
        - Extra coconut milk (for drizzling, optional)<br>
        - Sesame seeds or mung beans for garnish (optional)<br></p>
        
        <h2>Let's chop, simmer, and sauté our way to gastronomic glory!</h2>
        
        <p><b>Prepare the Sticky Rice:</b><br>
        
        1. Rinse the glutinous rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in enough water to cover it for at least 4 hours or overnight.<br>
        
        2. Drain the soaked rice.<br>
        
        3. In a steamer, steam the drained rice over high heat for about 30-40 minutes or until it's tender and cooked through.<br>
        
        4. While the rice is steaming, combine the coconut milk, granulated sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and set aside.<br>
        
        5. When the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large mixing bowl. Pour half of the coconut milk mixture over the rice and gently fold it in. Let the rice sit for about 15-20 minutes to absorb the coconut milk. Reserve the remaining coconut milk mixture for serving.<br>
        
        <b>Assemble the Mango Sticky Rice:</b><br>
        
        1. To serve, place a mound of sticky rice on a plate or banana leaf.<br>
        
        2. Arrange sliced mangoes on top of the sticky rice.<br>
        
        3. Drizzle with the reserved coconut milk mixture.<br>
        
        4. Optionally, garnish with sesame seeds or mung beans for added texture and flavor.<br>
        
        5. Serve the Mango Sticky Rice warm or at room temperature.<br>
        
        <b>Enjoy:</b><br>
        
        Mango Sticky Rice is traditionally enjoyed as a dessert, but it can also be served as a sweet snack. <br>The combination of the sweet, creamy rice and the juicy mangoes is simply delightful. Enjoy your homemade Mango Sticky Rice!</p>
