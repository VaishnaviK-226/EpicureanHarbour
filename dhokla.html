        9. 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br>
        
        <b>For the Tempering:</b><br>
        
        1. 2 tablespoons oil<br>
        2. 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds<br>
        3. 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds<br>
        4. 8-10 curry leaves<br>
        5. 2-3 green chilies, slit<br>
        6. A pinch of asafoetida (hing)<br>
        7. 2 tablespoons water<br>
        8. 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves<br>
        9. 1 tablespoon grated coconut (optional)</p>
        
        <h2>Let's chop, simmer, and sauté our way to gastronomic glory!</h2>
        
       <p><b>Prepare the Dhokla Batter:</b><br>
        
        1. In a mixing bowl, combine gram flour, rice flour, yogurt, ginger-green chili paste, turmeric powder, salt, sugar, and lemon juice.<br>
        
        2. Gradually add water while stirring to make a smooth, lump-free batter. The batter should be thick yet pourable. Set it aside for 10-15 minutes.<br>
        
        3. Grease a dhokla plate or a shallow, round dish that fits inside your steamer or pressure cooker. If using a pressure cooker, remove the whistle.<br>
        
        4. In a separate bowl, mix the fruit salt (eno) or baking soda with 2 tablespoons of water. Add this to the batter and stir well. The batter will become frothy.<br>
        
        5. Immediately pour the batter into the greased plate.<br>
        
        <b>Steam the Dhokla:</b><br>
        
        1. Place the plate inside a steamer or a pressure cooker without the whistle.<br>
        
        2. Steam the dhokla over medium-high heat for about 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.<br>
        
        <b>Prepare the Tempering:</b><br>
        
        1. Heat oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Allow them to splutter.<br>
        
        2. Add curry leaves, green chilies, and asafoetida. Sauté for a minute.<br>
        
        3. Add 2 tablespoons of water to the tempering to create steam and immediately pour this tempering evenly over the steamed dhokla.<br>
        
        <b>Serve the Dhokla:</b><br>
        
        1. Let the dhokla cool for a few minutes.<br>
        
        2. Cut it into desired shapes, like squares or diamonds.<br>
        
        3. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and grated coconut, if desired.<br>
        
        4. Serve dhokla with green chutney or tamarind chutney.<br>
